** Reciprocation
   There is an unspoken rule in society that we must reciprocate favors.
*** Rule of reciprocation
**** Christmas cards to strangers
     A university professor sent out Christmas cards to perfect strangers, and many of them sent back.
**** Hare Krishna persuasion
     Followers of the religion solicit donations at airports by offering flowers as "gifts" and then asking for a donation afterwards. This causes the victims to feel obliged to donate.
**** Evolutionary cause
     We are human because our ancestors learned to share resoures. It has created an intrinsic web of indebtedness. This sense of future obligation seems to be shared by no other animals.
**** University Coke experiment
     In a lecture scenario, and experimenter brings a Coke in for the subject as a gift during the break. When the subject is then asked to purchase raffle tickets, they comply. In a complication, it did not matter whether they even liked the experimenter personally. Also, the value of the tickets were much, much higher than the value of the Coke.
**** Amway samples
     Salespeople in Amway leave a consumable product with their prospects for days at a time. When the prospect ends up comsuming even a small amount (hair products, creams, etc), they feel obliged.
**** This rule puts all the action in the hands of the influencer.
     The influencer is the one who forces the victims hand which each step. The victim is compelled to receive the gift, then even more so to reciprocate on the next request.
**** A person who does not reciprocate becomes disliked by a social group.
     In this case, there is an additional burden to repay a favor when among many.
*** Reciprocal concessions
    We feel an obligation to make a concession when the other party has made a concession. A person who acts in a certain way toward us is entitled to a similar return action. The rejection-then-retreat technique. The second requests needs only to be smaller than the first.
**** Boy scout circus
     A scout stops you in the street and asks if you'd like to buy a ticket to the boy scout circus in Saturday night for five dollars. When you say no, he asks you to buy a chocolate for a dollar. You say yes. He conceded to a smaller request, and you recirocate the concession.
**** Zoo counseling experiment
     Students asked to spend two hours per week for two years as a volunteer counselor for youth said no. Right after, when asked instead to volunteer a single afternoon taking youth to the zoo, many said yes.
**** Television producers and censorship
     Aware of this effect, television producers will drop a lot more f-bombs then they actually want in a script. The censors will usually remove most of them, leaving the number the producers wanted.
**** Salespeople getting references.
     If a person comes to your door and says that one of your friends recommends you buy their product, you'll listen. Your friend offers this reference to the salesperson after refusing to buy their encyclopedias, as a concession when they are asked for recommendations.
**** Watergate
     A man named G. Gordon Liddy, an intelligence executive in the White House, wasn't particularly well-liked or respected. He proposed ridiculous ideas, far more so than the Watergate burglary, like stalking, kidnapping, and framing. The burglary was his concession "bare-bones" plan, and as ridiculous as it was, the executive team approved it.
**** Downselling instead of upselling
     Stores often put their most premium products front and center, or will pitch a luxury, premium product to a customer first. The economy ones seem like a bargain.
**** Request-then-retreat seems to lower victim's resentment and distrust.
     It seems conter-intuitive, but victims see the "retreat" component as a concession, and will usually stick to the commitment they've made to you.
**** Responsibility and satisfaction
     When request-then retreat is used, the victim feels most in control of the event. They feel they were responsibe for the lower price, and are more satisfied with the deal that was made.
**** How to say no to receiprocation
     Don't just reject the favors given. That's hard to do and you'll fail. Just accept the favor and, if you feel like you're being exploited, walk away. They're exploiting you, and you're simply reciprocating by exploiting the exploitment.
** Commitment and Consistentcy
    When we get victims to commit to an idea, they'll start to self-identify with it and begin to comply to it. We pride ourselves on being consistent, so we stick to our commitments. As Michael Faraday said when asked if a rival was always wrong: "He's not that consistent".
**** Betters at a race track.
     Thirty seconds after placing a bet on a horse, gamblers report being more optimistic about the horse winning.
**** Watch my things.
     A stranger on a beach sits beside a subject, walks away, and a thief comes and steals their radio. Not many people go after the thief. But when the stranger asks you to watch their things, almmost everyone chases the thief down.
**** Consistency as a form of automatic responding.
     Once we've made up our minds about an issue, we're unlikely to revisit it, and we'll automatically act accordingly. This helps us from having to consider every decision through the day, but it can be hacked.
**** Consistency as a form of not wanting to think about something difficult.
     We pay money for self-help books and silly classes as a way of not thinking about the things in our lives that cause us pain.
**** Toy manufactures and parent promises
     Toy companies have a problem making sales after Christmas, when parents have spent their budgets. In response, they adopt a strategy of marketing a hot toy heavily before Christmas, then under-stocking the shelves. Parents promise the toy to their children, then have to make up for it with other gifts when the toy is sold out. After Christmas, the ads start up again and the kids want the toy their parents promised. The parents want to stick to their commitments, so they comply and purchase in January.
**** Soliciting volunteers
     When, on a simple survey, people are asked if they would spend three hours volunteering for a charity, they say yes. Most people want to think of themselves as charitable. Then, a week later, when someone unrelated to the survey asks them to commit to volunteering, they are more inclined to say yes to support their self-image.
**** Chinese POWs in Korean War.
     To gain compliance from hard-lipped American prisoners, the Chinese started with lenience. This led them to be very effective in getting Americans to rat on each other. First, an American would be asked to make harmless, anti-American or pro-Chinese statements ("America is not perfect", "Unemployment is not a problem in a communist country"). Then, they would be asked to elaborate on these minor statements, explaining their thinking, and then writing the reasons in a list and signing their name. Essays might be written and broadcast to the amp, so that they indentify publicly with their writing. Since the American is aware that he was not forced to write the document, he changes his image to be consistent with his new "collaborator" label. Essay contests would be held that awarded essays that were only slightly pro-Communist, encougaring the prisoners to make small concessions.
**** He is no longer your prospect, he is your customer.
     A common strategy is to convince people to make a tiny purchase, hardly big enough to justify the sales process. That small commitment paves the way for larger ones.
**** The beautification petition.
     People who signed a petition to "Keep California Beautiful" were primed to see themselves as public-spirited citizens. When, two weeks later, they were asked to put an ugly sign on their lawn, many complied.
**** Written commitment is very powerful.
     As in the Chinese example, a victim cannot believe that he hasn't committed if he wrote a document. Furthermore, it can be shown to other people, solidifying their image to the public.
**** Public commitments tend to be lasting commitments.
     A society values personal consistency, and we are always trying to live up to that. Even when we changed our minds on a public stance of ours, our reasoning is that the change is consistent with another aspect of our personality. People that declare their stance in public are far less likely to change their minds.
**** Written commitments require more effort, which begets commitment.
     We know that effort to join a group or society prolongs our loyalty to it. Think about the motivations for hazing or initiation rituals.
**** Effective commitments are active, public, and effortful
     This is why college hazing is so effective.
**** We accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we have performed with without outside pressures.
     This is why the rewards for the Chinese essay-writing contests were small, like just a few cigarettes. It is why hazing doesn't focus on doing productive public services.
**** Disuading children from playing with a toy.
     7 year olds will only temporarily comply to a threat of punishment. In an experiment, boys threatened with punishment not to play with a robot toy when left alone in a room mostly complied. But weeks later, back in the room without the threat, most play with the robot. In a redo, the boys were told playing with the robot was wrong, with no threat of punishment. Left alone, most complied, but then weeks later they complied again. The boys now felt responsibility for the decision was theirs and they stuck to it. They didn't play with the robot because they didn't want to.
**** Car salesman low-balling
     A salesman might offer a car $400 under asking to get a customer to agree to buy. The commitment is furthered with all the add ons, contracts, etc. At the last minute, a feature that was missing from the discounted car is added back in for $400. The important part was getting in the customer's head that they're going to buy the car. Provide lots of strong legs for the purchase so that when the first leg is pulled away, there is no collapse.
**** Energy conserving experiment
     Families in Iowa who wouldn't conserve energy over the winter we're offered their names printed in the paper if they met a target goal. Many agreed, and started feeling good about their efforts over the winter. The came to realize the other benefits of conserving energy. When the publicity offer was revoked, they maintained their behavior.
**** How to avoid the traps of consistency.
     Tell the persuader what they're doing. Agree that consistency is important, but that you feel your consistency is being exploited. To avoid the low-balling effect, ask yourself "Would I make this deal again with the new price?".
** Social Proof
**** Television laugh tracks
     Like the "cheep cheep" that makes turkey mothers care for their young, laugh tracks stimulate us for our natural responses.
**** "Salting" the tip jar
     Bartenders and church ushers will throw a few bills in before passing the tip jar around as a method of social proof. See also lines outside clubs, the "fastest-selling" products. "95% of people are imitators, 5% initiators".
**** The Chicago doomsday cult
     When religious groups predict the end of the world, it seems like their belief is only re-enforced when they are disproven. Researchers infiltrated, undercover, a modern cult shortly before their proposed dooms date. They found that member's beliefs were most feverous in this time, as they threw away all their possesions in preparation to leave the earth, even in the face of intervention by their friends. Secondly, they did surprisingly little to spread the word to non-cult members. After camping out all night waiting to be saved, the believers realized that the end was not coming. Finally, they shifted into becoming zealous missionaries. They had all invested so much into the doomsday cult, and couldn't bear the realization that it wouldn't be true. But trying to convert more people to their beliefs strengthened them, as if it would make the predictions truer if they could get more people. "The greater the number of people who find any idea correct, the more the idea will be correct".
**** Pluralistic ignorance
     The phenomenon that explains bystander inaction. Is a man lying in an alley having a heart attract? Are loud bangs always gunshots? When emergency is ambigious, we look around at others for clues. What we forget, is that everyone else is looking for clues too. Since we keep our flustered confusion private, we try and sneak glances at other bystanders so we are not noticed. This means everyone is likely to see everyone else just standing around. And since nobody is concerned, nothing must be wrong. In many experiments, larger groups of bystanders have lead to less reporting of emergency situations.
**** Catherine Genovese
     In 1964, a young woman was brutally murdered in the street in Queens. Nearly fourty people watched in their apartments for thirty five minutes, with no one calling the police. The first reason was that everyone assumed someone else would. The second reason involves the pluralistic ignorance effect.
